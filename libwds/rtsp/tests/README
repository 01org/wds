How to fuzz WDS parser
=======================

1) Get afl-fuzz from http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/ and follow
   "QuickStartGuide" http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/QuickStartGuide.txt

2) Build WDS with WDS_FUZZER support. Provide full path to afl-gcc / afl-g++
   or add path containing afl-* binaries to your PATH environment variable.
   CC=afl-gcc CXX=afl-g++ cmake -DWDS_FUZZER=ON --disable-shared .

3) Run run_afl_fuzzer.sh script which is located under libwds/rtsp/tests folder
   ./libwds/rtsp/tests/run_afl_fuzzer.sh PATH_TO_AFL_FUZZ TEST_RESULT_PATH
   e.g. ./libwds/rtsp/tests/run_afl_fuzzer.sh afl-fuzz test_results
   Four fuzzer jobs will be started (header, payload_request, payload_response
   and payload_response_error)

4) Observe progress in separate xterm terminal or use afl-whatsup to get overall
   status of fuzzing jobs with afl-whatsup.
   afl-whatsup test_results or afl-whatsup -s test_results

5) For more information check http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/README.txt or docs
   folder under afl-fuzz source tree.
